# 📚 Project Description 

The purpose of the site is to act as an *interactive web glossary* for Web-Development debutants to learn the fundamental concepts of **HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.** 

The most prominent pedagogical component of the site is its demonstration of *Progressive Enhancement*, where the glossary is intentionally published in the following 3 progressive layers: 

1. ***HTML Only*** - A **fully functional** HTML-Only static page explaining essential HTML elements.
2. ***HTML + CSS*** - Adds visual styling and structure to the previous page while introducing key CSS concepts. 
3. ***HTML + CSS + JavaScript*** - Completes the fully interactive website demonstrating and teaching dunamic behavior and real-time features dependant on Javascript code logic.

*Each stage builds upon the previous, introducing new educational content while remaining independently accessible and navigable.*
